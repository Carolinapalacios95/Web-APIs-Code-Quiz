# Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

>## Description

   This quiz begins with a Start Screen which displays a brief intro paragraph about how to take the quiz. 

   Once a user begins they are taken to a new screen and presented with the first question as the timer at the top right starts counting down from 60 seconds.

   A user may choose from the 4 options presented. If they choose correctly, then they will see a "Correct!" message displayed. If they select incorrectly, then a "Wrong Answer!" message will display instead and 15 seconds will be removed from the timer. 

   At the end of the quiz, when time has reached 0, the End Screen will display showing a user's final score and allowing them to input their initials & save their score.

   When a user hits submit, they are taken to a Highscores page where they can see the previous scores from previous attempts by other users. 

   When a User hits go back they are taken back to the Start Screen and all scores are saved. Or, if they select the Clear Highscores button, the page is reloaded and all the previously saved scores are deleted. 



>## Code Style & Tech/Framework Used

  For this project, I've utilized Visual Studio Code in order to build this webpage's html, css attributes and implement javascript functionality.

>## Features

*  Applied and showcased the core skills I've recently learned: Javascript such as timer intervals, event listeners, for loops, data sttributes, and accessing/saving to local storage.

* Followed best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, and quality comments.

* Included a preview of the webpage within this ReadME, which displays the tools we've learned thus far in the coding bootcamp.
